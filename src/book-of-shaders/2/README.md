From: Chapter 3, Uniforms, of The Book of Shaders

Purpose of the exercise:
Color the quad with different colors depending on fragment shader position, and make the color change over time.

Uses:
- uniform for canvas width and height to calculate a standard coordinate system for fragment shaders
- uniform to represent time: `(performance.now - previous) / 1000`
